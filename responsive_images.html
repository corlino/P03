    <h1>Responsive Images Demo</h1>
    <p>As part of making your websites more 'responsive friendly', there are a couple of proposals for responsive images that were developed by the <a href="positioning.html">Responsive Images Community Group</a>. There is the &lt;picture&gt; element which allows for 'art direction' of an image by using multiple sources, as well as the "srcset" attribute which allows us to offer browsers a variety of image resolutions to choose from.</p>
    <p>It is a good idea to take a look at <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=srcset" target="_blank">how supported "srcset"</a> and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=picture" target="_blank">the &lt;picture&gt; element</a> are before use.</p>



    <section id="srcset">

      <h2>"srcset" Example</h2>

      <!-- 
        The srcset attribute is designed to deliver different sizes of images based on the resolution of the display which is requesting them. We specify different resolution 'densities' or multiples after specifying the location of the file in a comma-seperated list. Note that the "src" attribute is still used to ensure that we are progressively enhancing (not eliminating) support from browsers that do not understand how 'srcset' works.
      -->
      <img src="img/Image-x1.jpg" srcset="img/Image-x2.jpg 2x, img/Image-x3.jpg 3x" alt="A wall with grafitti illustrating a face and the words 'the world just watched'">

    </section>




    <section id="picture">
 
      <h2>&lt;picture&gt; Example</h2>

      <!--
        The <picture> tag is another proposal meant to help more of the 'art direction' of images in a design, allowing us to specify different image sources based on the size of the page that has been loaded.
      -->
      <picture>

        <!-- 
          Here we have our first image source being specified using the <source> element. Within it, the "media" attribute (much like a media query) declares that anything above 1200px wide (screen-wise) should load our largest asset. Note that we could also provide multiple pixel density sources in our "srcset" attribute if we had them. 
        -->
        <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" srcset="img/Image-x3.jpg 1x">

        <!-- 
          If the conditions of our source listing(s) above are not met - we could have many -  we offer a 'default' source for our images.
        -->
        <source srcset="img/Image-cropped-x1.jpg 1x, img/Image-cropped-x2.jpg 2x">

        <!--
          Here we can include the same code we did earlier for our image tag to ensure that we allow the browser to still load an image as it is capable.
        -->
        <img src="img/Image-x1.jpg" srcset="img/Image-x2.jpg 2x, img/Image-x3.jpg 3x" alt="A wall with grafitti illustrating a face and the words 'the world just watched'">
