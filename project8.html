<h4 class="featurette-heading">Fall 2022</h4>
<p class="lead">This was a fun personal project of mine to contribute to Burnaby's Leeside Skatepark graffiti wall. This was made around Halloween time and I wanted the message to be relatable to a lot of other artists that paint in this tunnel, acknowledging that the most relaxing time to paint is at night. This managed to stay up in the tunnel for around 3 months before being covered by another artist.</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
This was made using Rust-oleum spraypaint.

<h4 class="featurette-heading">Spring 2023</h4>
<p class="lead">This was a quick project I had planned to get a better grasp on creating hands and the shapes required to do so. I explored different colours and gradients that overall made the piece pop and be seen from far away. This has since been covered by other artists.</p>
