<p class="lead">In this project, I took it upon myself to challenge my abilities in UI/UX Design and develop a fictional app idea and build it out enough to appear like a real application.</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
The idea for this is that it's a mobile application that is intended to match a user with their desired company and encourage them to invest in that company.

<p class="lead">This app would function exactly like Tinder, where users can create a profile, then start swiping. This is a very common activity for people in modern times, so this was also important when thinking about usability and how easy individuals would understand using this interface.</p>

<p class="lead"> 
The app looks identical to Tinder, and my reasoning for this was because Tinder is ranked #1 in lifestyle apps on the app store, which indicates that their are millions of users around the world. When people see this app, I wanted them to think of Tinder, an app that they are most likely familiar with, or atleast understand how to use it. This makes usability for an app like this less cognitively taxing for new users.</p>
