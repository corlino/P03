<h4 class="featurette-heading">An Interactive Installation</h4>
<p class="lead">This was a group project for an interactive arts course I took in the Summer of 2022 where we were tasked with creating an interactive art installation similar to one that would be seen in a gallery. </p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
This project started with our group looking for inspiration from interactive art installations that we had discussed during our lectures for the class. The artworks which we had a common interest in included one called Body Movies (2001) by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and another called Telematic Dreaming (1992) by Paul Sermon. Both of which involved the projection of an image or video onto a display that could be interacted with.
</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
For this project I mainly used my rented equipment from the SFU library and the illustrations were made using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

<p class="lead">The idea behind the installation would be that atleast two participants would place their hands in a two rectangular boxes where cameras were set up on one end, streaming the otherside live and displaying both onto the same projector screen. This would create the interaction which would make two seperate participants seem like they are together on one screen. </p>
    
<p class="lead">The equipment borrowed from the library included two projectors, two digital cameras, and a portable projector screen. The boxes were crafted by our team using cardboard and construction paper.</p>

<p class="lead">The boxes were built in a way that would hide the cameras in a section of the box and have it view a closed off section on the other side of the box. This would be the stage where users could put their hands or objects in and see it displayed on the screen.</p>

<p class="lead">We set up posters outside the room to create an intriguing visual element that would have individuals curious about what was going on inside. Since this was an interactive installation we needed participants to interact with the boxes.</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Goals</h2>
<p class="lead">The goals for this project was that it simulated how people were connecting with one another through remote settings while working and interacting online during the pandemic between 2020-2022. It takes a unique approach and shows how people could be in seperate spaces and still be together at the same time through modern technological mediums such as telecommunication applications which was commonly used during this time period. </p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Reflection</h2>
<p class="lead">This project was an organic product that stemmed from interactive art inspiration and successful planning. All parts of this project worked correctly with our original idea and had remained unchanged throughout the process with the exception of a few minor changes. This was a positive experience collaborating with my four other teammates and all of our participants had enjoyed their experience interacting with the artwork and provided us with a great number of positive feedback.</p>
