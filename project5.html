<h4 class="featurette-heading">Basic Intro to Circuits</h4>
<p class="lead">This was a group project for an introduction to technological systems course I took in the Summer of 2022 where we were tasked with creating an aesthetically pleasing product using atleast three electrical sensors and functioning code. </p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
This project started with our group of four exploring possible options for a topic of our project. We all had a similar interest in the educational tool stream and decided to make this the focus of our product.
</p>
<br>

<p class = "lead">
Our initial idea was a broad tool for drawing which children would be able to use to practice their writing virtually. In this iteration we realized from feedback given by our professor, that this idea was too broad and would need to be narrowed down to get a stronger concept.
</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
From this exploration and feedback we did further research that lead us to developing an educational tool where users between the ages of 15-20 would be able to practice graffiti-style artwork in an alternative and non-destructive way. 
</p>
    
<p class = "lead">
The software I used for creating the illustrations was adobe illustrator, and the technical components were controlled using Arduino and Processing.

<p class="lead">In the initial sketches for this project we looked into having a remote controller as the object we could draw with and use it in combination with a processing sketch that would map the movement of the cursor and draw.</p>
    
<p class="lead"> For our three sensors we used a rotary sensor, force sensing resistor and a 9-axis accelerometer. Throughout the term we learned the basics of using analogue resisting sensors, but the accelerometer was a difficult component to use. Initially we had a 3-axis accelerometer but found out that would not be feasible with out projects goals.</p>

<div class="row featurette">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p class="lead">Each of the sensors would cooperate with one another and would vary in function. The rotary sensor would stick out of the side and let the user change the stroke color, the force sensor would determine the diameter of the circle, and the accelerometer would control the movement of the cursor. In addition our teaching assistant recommended that we use a radio transmission sensor to communicate the data from the computer to the remote without a wired connection to enhance mobility. </p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Rust-oleum Spraypaint</h2>
<p class="lead">For the housing of all the electrical components we used a real Rust-oleum spraypaint can that was safely emptied and opened up. This was divided into three pieces that would be used to be the shell of the electrical components. This also served as a way of creating an authentic experience for the user</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Remote Housing</h2>
<p class="lead">The lower compartment of the spraycan housed the electrical components and contained spaces between the upper and lower sections to allow for the wiring and sensors to stick out. We had the accelerometer stuck to the bottom of the top section of the can since this needed to be callibrated and fixed to one spot. The rotary sensor was accessible from the outside of the can and the radio transmission sensor needed to be outside to hold a stronger connection to the computer. The force sensor was wired through the spacing between the top and bottom, then taped to the of the spraycan cap.</p>

<div class="col-md-5">
<h2 class="featurette-heading">Beacon Housing</h2>
<p class="lead">The beacon would connect the computer to the remote and would transmit the date of the accelerometer and sensors to the processing sketch. This would track the movement, thickness and colour of the cursor.</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Processing Sketch</h2>
<p class="lead">In processing the code would work similar to a cursor but linked to the sensors in the can. This would emit a drawing onto the display which shows a connect-the-dot type of excercise to help the user learn this style of art.</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Reflection</h2>
<p class="lead">Creating AirBrush was intense and would not have been possible without my three team members. The main aspects of the project that I contributed to was the aesthetic of the remote and beacon housing, concept artwork, and support for electronics and coding. </p>
    <br>
<p class="lead">We had opted to go with an advanced electronic device in a basic technological systems course, where even our teaching staff was limited in the guidance they were offering us. Although not having the best grasp on technology and coding, I was able to learn a lot from the project and I'm glad I was able to create this surrounding a topic that interests me. </p>
