   <h3>Process</h3>
   <p>
Displayed here is a course project from one of my Interactive Arts & Technology program courses. Information Design was the class title and it focused on the way content was represented in a professionally designed presentation using hierarchy and grid structures. 
<br><br>
In this project, the class was instructed to work individually to create magazine spreads that would include material from a photographer that would be appropriately placed following our art direction. I was to create three magazine spreads that would work coherently as a whole to form a total of six pages.
<br><br>
The photographer I chose was Jürgen Schadeberg, who was a German photographer who was responsible for a lot of the emotional photographs during the South African Apartheid. 
<br><br>
The ways for which I placed the content on each spread were driven by hierarchy and the way in which the human eye would move throughout the compositions. In the end, I was able to create a professional magazine spread that utilizes grid structure and white space that lets the viewer read with minimal distractions on each page.

   <h3>Process</h3>
   <p>

Displayed here is the final project from one of my Interactive Arts & Technology program courses. The class Digital Image Design was focused on teaching the fundamentals of digital and graphic design. 
<br><br>
The goal of the project was to demonstrate our skills using Adobe After Effects in a kinetic typography project. We were instructed to make a thirty second to one minute and a half video that focuses on moving typography that follows along with a dialogue of our choice.
<br><br>
I based my final project on a speech from the 1941 film Citizen Kane. The narrator is giving an overview of the mansion that the main character of the film lived in. I created many of the elements in both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, then transferred them to the Adobe video software After Effects. From here I was able to import the edited audio file from Adobe Audition and begin implementing the moving elements.  
<br><br>
Through doing the project I was in the mindset that this was going to be one of the greatest projects I had made in the two semesters I had been at school.​ During the process, I was thinking about how the project was based around a movie that I really admired and how I would need to work harder to achieve an outcome that would represent my appreciation for Citizen Kane. When I found out that I had not done as well as I was expecting, I was still satisfied with the skills I gained from doing the project and the quality of the end result. This project is one of the most important to me since It significantly developed my interest in videography and increased my skills in video editing with graphics and typography.
