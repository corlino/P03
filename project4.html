<h3 class="featurette-heading">PNI Graphic Design Co-op</h3>
<p class="lead">In the Summer and Fall of 2021, I was hired as a Graphic Designer at a Biotech Manufacturing company called Precision NanoSystems Inc. During my time at PNI I worked on a variety of graphic design projects which included posters, slide decks, flyers, social media graphics, brochures and scientific diagrams. This was my first experience being apart of an official company's marketing team.</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
The project I have displayed here to represent my time at PNI, is the <b>GMP System Brochure</b>. This would be given to clients to inform them about the capabilities of PNI's GMP System which is one of the main genomic development instruments that they manufacture.
</p>

<br>
<p class = "lead">
The software I used for this project includes Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.

<p class="lead">After developing a general idea for how I wanted some of the layouts to look, I proceeded to crop each of the photos I planned to use and apply minor colour alterations to make sure each layout had a consistant black and white theme. Each image was chosen to contrast eachother between pages on each spread.</p>

</div>

<hr class="featurette-divider">

<div class="row featurette">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p class="lead"> 
My idea for the first spread was to have a large eye-catching full-bleed image on the right side that would directly contrast the image on the left. As you can see, the moods of the two images contrast eachother, while also being able to compliment the layout of text.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">

<img src="img/1.JPG" alt="work">

</div>
</div>

<hr class="featurette-divider">

<div class="row featurette">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p class="lead"> 
For the second spread, my plan was to make the images contrast based on the emotions of each to remain consistent. The photos were cropped in a way that aligned with the top and bottom of the text blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">

<img src="img/2.JPG" alt="work">

</div>
</div>

<hr class="featurette-divider">

<div class="row featurette">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p class="lead"> On the final spread, I achieved a contrast between different elements of fine arts. These images were also grouped with text blocks of relevant information while also balancing between content and white-space.</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Reflection</h2>

<p class="lead">Through this project I was able to look at the work of J&#252;rgen Schadeberg who was responsible for a lot of the photos that showed life under apartheid in South African. I was able to explore this photographer and understand his style while testing my skills in Adobe Photoshop and InDesign to create an interesting publication. This was a great experience and the result was an appealing and professional magazine spread. </p>
