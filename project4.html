<h3 class="featurette-heading">PNI Graphic Design Co-op</h3>
<p class="lead">In the Summer and Fall of 2021, I was hired as a Graphic Designer at a Biotech Manufacturing company called Precision NanoSystems Inc. During my time at PNI I worked on a variety of graphic design projects which included posters, slide decks, flyers, social media graphics, brochures and scientific diagrams. This was my first experience being apart of an official company's marketing team.</p>
<br>
<p class = "lead">
The project I have displayed here to represent my time at PNI, is the <b>GMP System Brochure</b>. This would be given to clients to inform them about the capabilities of PNI's GMP System which is one of the main genomic development instruments that they manufacture.
</p>

<br>
<p class = "lead">
The software I used for this project includes Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign.

In this project I was given the task of creating a new GMP brochure. The brochure would include all the necessary information and data that a client should know about the instrument before making a decision, similar to when you look at a vacation brochure before taking a trip.

This threefold brochure would be able to solve the problem related to the lack of available information about the GMP by having this short document explaining what this technology can do. The brochure will also always be available on PNI’s website for anyone who is interested and preparing for the commercialization of their drug product.</p>

<p class="lead">Each instrument is associated with a certain colour. The official colour of the GMP System is “Scale-up Purple” but for the brochure, there were special instructions to try and avoid using this colour since the main colours are orange, teal and blue from the logo. The GMP System was different from its counterparts in that it did not share a colour with the PNI logo and had a more industrial look to it.

I came up with the idea of making a purple and a blue accented version of the brochure and before progressing further, get those ideas presented to the two founders of PNI and have them choose. After the review, it came back to me, and they had chosen to go forward with the purple version, hightlighted in yellow in the image on the right.

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Reflection</h2>

<p class="lead">This brochure was one of the most complex projects that I worked on throughout the term which in total took around two months to get completed. When I was assigned this project in early July I felt prepared since at this point I had two months of prior experience with the PNI brand. This was a good experience for me to take what I had previously learned from the smaller branding projects such as social media posts and presentation editing, and apply them to the brochure. This project also required significant collaboration with one of the product marketing managers to get all the content together and back and forth conversations about revisions and content updates. I was eager to work with others on this project since working from home makes collaboration more difficult, and this was a great opportunity to work with others in the marketing department.
