        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Magazine Layout Design</h2>
        <p class="lead">In this project, we were instructed to work individually to create magazine spreads that would include material from a photographer that would be appropriately placed to follow our art directions. The project was to create three magazine spreads that would work coherently as a whole to form a total of six pages. This project required me to use my skills in Adobe Photoshop, and InDesign.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "lead">
         The photographer I chose was Jürgen Schadeberg, who was a German photographer who was responsible for a lot of the emotional photographs during the South African Apartheid.

    <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
        
        <p class="lead">After developing a general idea for how I wanted some of the layouts to look, I proceeded to crop each of the photos I planned to use and apply minor colour alterations to make sure each layout had a consistant black and white theme. Each image was chosen to contrast eachother between pages on each spread.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5 order-md-1">
        
          <img src="img/process.JPG" width="100%" height="100%">

    <hr class="featurette-divider">

    <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-5">
       
        <p class="lead"> 
My idea for the first spread was to have a large eye-catching full-bleed image on the right side that would directly contrast the image on the left. As you can see, the moods of the two images contrast eachother, while also being able to compliment the layout of text.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
   
          <img src="img/1.JPG" width="100%" height="100%">
          
      </div>
    </div>

    <hr class="featurette-divider">
        
       <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-5">
       
        <p class="lead"> 
For the second spread, my plan was to make the images contrast based on the emotions of each to remain consistent. The photos were cropped in a way that aligned with the top and bottom of the text blocks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
   
          <img src="img/2.JPG" width="100%" height="100%">

        <hr class="featurette-divider">
        
       <div class="row featurette">
      <div class="col-md-5">
       
        <p class="lead"> On the final spread, I achieved a contrast between different elements of fine arts. These images were also grouped with text blocks of relevant information while also balancing between content and white-space.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Reflection</h2>
          
        <p class="lead">Through this project I was able to look at the work of Jürgen Schadeberg who was responsible for a lot of the photos that showed life under apartheid in South African. I was able to explore this photographer and understand his style while testing my skills in Adobe Photoshop and InDesign to create an interesting publication. This was a great experience and the result was an appealing and professional magazine spread. </p>
